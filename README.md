# OnionMap #
This code was written for the research on the routing algorithms in 3D sensor networks. You can read my paper "*OnionMap: A Scalable Geometric Addressing and Routing Scheme for 3D Sensor Networks*" to get a better understanding of the OnionMap routing algorithm. 

## Compiling Environment ##
Visual Studio 2010 or above

## Contents ##
This code implemented the landmark triangulation, Euclidean Ricci Flow method and the Uniform Sphere Mapping.

## Remark ##
- Generally, the code would work just fine except for some special tricky cases.
- I put the code here just for sharing. However, I would no longer maintain this code.
- **If you are really interested in how this code works, please drop me an Email**.
